# Local Development

These steps will setup this repo on your machine for local development for the majority of the components in this repo.
By default the extension will connect to contracts already deployed on Arbitrum Nitro testnet and a public Aggregator running on https://arbitrum-goerli.blswallet.org/
If you would like to target a remote network instead, follow the steps outlined in [Remote Development](./remote_development.md).

## Dependencies

### Required

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) (`npm install -g yarn`)
- [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation)

### Optional (Recomended)

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup

Install the latest Node 16. If using nvm to manage node versions, run this in the root directory:

```sh
nvm install
```

Run the repo setup script

```sh
./setup.ts
```

## Chain (RPC Node)

Start a local Hardhat node for RPC use.

```sh
cd ./contracts
yarn hardhat node
```

## Deploy Contracts

### Deployer account

BLS Wallet contract deploys use `CREATE2` to maintain consistent addresses across networks. As such, a create2 deployer contract is used and listed in `./contracts/.env` under the environment variables `DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC` & `DEPLOYER_SET_INDEX`. The hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet address will need to be funded in order to deploy the contracts.

If you do not need consistent addresses, for example on a local or testnet network, you can replace the `DEPLOYER_MNEMONIC` with another seed phrase which already has a funded account. Run the following command to fund the deployer:

Fund the `create2Deployer`.

```sh
cd ./contracts # if not already there
yarn hardhat fundDeployer --network gethDev
```

From the same terminal/shell instance, deploy all `bls-wallet` contracts.

```sh
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy_all.ts --network gethDev
```

## Aggregator

The [aggregator](../aggregator/) is a service that accepts transaction bundles (including those that contain a single transaction) and submits aggregations of these bundles to L2.

Update these values in `./aggregator/.env`.
See [aggregator](../aggregator/README.md) for a detailed breakdown of each env property.

```sh
RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
...
NETWORK_CONFIG_PATH=../contracts/networks/local.json
...
```

```sh
cd .. # root of repo
docker-compose up -d postgres # Or see local postgres instructions in ./aggregator/README.md#PostgreSQL
```

```sh
cd ./aggregator
./programs/aggregator.ts
```

## Extension

The [extension](../extension/) (otherwise referred to as Quill) is a prototype extension wallet used to showcase and test BLS Wallet features. **Note it is not a production wallet.**

make these changes in extension > .env

```sh
AGGREGATOR_URL=http://localhost:3000/
DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID=31337
NETWORK_CONFIG=./contracts/networks/local.json
```

In a seperate terminal/shell instance

```sh
cd ./extension
yarn run dev:chrome # or dev:firefox, dev:opera
```

### Chrome

1. Go to Chrome's [extension page](chrome://extensions).
2. Enable `Developer mode`.
3. Either click `Load unpacked extension...` and select `./extension/extension/chrome` or drag that folder into the page.

### Firefox

1. Go to Firefox's [debugging page](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox).
2. Click `Load Temporary Add-on...`.
3. Select `./extension/extension/firefox/manifest.json`.

**After this, you now have all the main components setup to begin local development.**

### Tests

See each components `README.md` for how to run tests.

## Testing/using updates to ./clients

### extension

```sh
cd ./contracts/clients
yarn build
yarn link
cd ../extension
yarn link bls-wallet-clients
```

If you would like live updates to from the clients package to trigger reloads of the extension, be sure to comment out this section of `./extension/weback.config.js`:

```javascript
...
module.exports = {
  ...
  watchOptions: {
    // Remove this if you want to watch for changes
    // from a linked package, such as bls-wallet-clients.
    ignored: /node_modules/,
  },
  ...
};
```

### aggregator

You will need to push up an `@experimental` version to 'bls-wallet-clients' on npm and update the version in `./aggregtor/src/deps.ts` until a local linking solution for deno is found. See https://github.com/alephjs/esm.sh/discussions/216 for details.
You will need write access to the npmjs project to do this. You can request access or request one of the BLS Wallet project developers push up your client changes in the `Discussions` section of this repo.

In `./contracts/clients` with your changes:

```sh
yarn publish-experimental
```

Note the `x.y.z-abc1234` version that was output.

Then in `./aggregtor/deps.ts`, change all `from` references for that package.

```typescript
...
} from "https://esm.sh/bls-wallet-clients@x.y.z-abc1234";
...
```
